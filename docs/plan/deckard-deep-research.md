# Building a Real-Time Personal AI Avatar (Voice & Video Clone) in 24 Hours

## Overview and Goals

We aim to create a **digital “clone” of a person** that looks and sounds like them, and can engage in real-time conversation. The clone will be built from a short video of the user (a few seconds to a few minutes long) and will **learn and mimic the user’s voice, appearance, and conversational style**. The user can interact with this avatar via voice or text in a live chat interface, and the avatar will respond with both **synthesized speech (in the user’s cloned voice)** and a **talking video avatar** whose mouth moves realistically to the speech. Over time, through continued interactions, the avatar should adapt and **update its memory/preferences** to become more personalized to the user. All of this needs to be achievable quickly (within roughly 24 hours of development), using existing APIs or open-source tools, and within a demo budget of around $200.

To accomplish this, we need to integrate several components:

* **Visual Avatar Creation:** Generating a talking head model from the user’s video/image, with realistic lip-sync.

* **Voice Cloning:** Creating a text-to-speech voice that matches the user’s voice from the sample video.

* **Speech Recognition and Input Handling:** Capturing the user’s spoken or typed queries in real time.

* **Conversational AI (Brain):** Using a powerful language model (GPT-4/“GPT-5”) to generate responses, with context memory.

* **Speech Synthesis and Lip-Sync Animation:** Converting the AI’s text response into the cloned voice audio, and animating the avatar’s face (especially mouth movements) to match the audio.

* **Interaction Interface:** A front-end where the user can see and hear the avatar and converse naturally (either by speaking or typing), with low latency.

* **Learning and Memory:** Mechanisms to retain conversational context and progressively adjust the avatar’s responses to better reflect the user’s personality and preferences.

Below, we break down the plan for each component, highlighting **tools/technologies** to use and how to integrate them. We will consider both **ready-to-use services/APIs** (for speed of development) and **open-source solutions** (for flexibility and cost control), given the time and budget constraints.

## 1\. Extracting Likeness from the User’s Video

The first step is to capture the user’s visual likeness – essentially creating the **avatar’s face**. With only a short video (a few seconds long), a practical approach is to extract one or a few high-quality frames of the user’s face from the video to use as the avatar’s image. Many AI avatar systems can work with a single photo to generate a talking head video. In our case, we can either use a single frame (assuming the video has a clear, front-facing shot) or the entire video to create a more dynamic model.

**Option A: Use an Avatar Generation API** – Services like **D-ID** or **HeyGen** or **A2E (Avatars2Everyone)** allow you to upload an image or a short video and will create a talking digital avatar for you. For example, D-ID’s Generative AI API can animate a still photo into a lifelike speaking avatar and even offers a real-time streaming mode for low-latency output. Another service, KreadoAI, advertises an “**Instant Avatar Clone**” feature: you can *“upload a video of 5 seconds or more, and get your free digital twin in just 1 minute\!”*, with perfect lip-sync and even 1:1 action replication of the source video. This suggests that if we provide a short, well-lit video of the user speaking, their system can quickly train a model of the user's face and mannerisms. We could leverage such a service if available (depending on pricing or free trial) to bootstrap our avatar.

**Option B: Use an Open-Source Talking Head Model** – To avoid external service limits, we can generate the talking avatar ourselves using known lip-sync or talking-head models. A widely used approach is to take the user’s photo and use a neural lip-sync model like **Wav2Lip** to animate the mouth according to input audio. Wav2Lip (and its variants) can be run locally (with a GPU) or on a cloud instance, and achieves convincing lip synchronization without requiring a pre-trained avatar of the specific person. Essentially, Wav2Lip will take our chosen image of the user and any speech audio (from our AI’s response) and output a video where the image’s mouth moves realistically in sync with the audio. This avoids needing a lengthy avatar training process – it uses a “universal” lip-sync model applicable to any face. The quality is generally good (Wav2Lip set a strong baseline for lip-sync quality), though the rest of the face remains relatively static (we might only get mouth movement, and perhaps slight head motion if using variants like *SadTalker*, which can add some expressions/gestures). Given the hackathon timeframe, Wav2Lip is a great choice for a quick implementation because it’s well-documented and easy to integrate in code. If needed, more advanced one-shot talking face models (e.g. *OTAvatar or MuseTalk*) exist that add head and eye movements for more realism, but they might require more powerful hardware or complex setup. We can start with Wav2Lip for simplicity and speed.

**Avatar Training vs. On-the-fly Animation:** Some platforms (like HeyGen or the full KreadoAI studio) allow training a personalized model of the user that can produce higher realism (perhaps matching the user’s head movements or expressions), but these can take hours or days to train – not feasible in a 24h hack. Instead, we’ll likely either use an instant method (like the *instant clone* which presumably skips heavy training at some cost of quality) or the aforementioned Wav2Lip which doesn’t require per-user training. A2E’s API documentation mentions a “universal lip-sync model” vs. a “dedicated trained model” for an avatar – using the universal model (no custom training) is faster but slightly less accurate. For our demo, **speed is critical**, so we will initially skip any long training and rely on the general lip-sync solution. We just need a clear image of the user’s face and the ability to animate it with audio.

*Implementation Notes:* If we choose the API route (say D-ID or A2E), we will call their endpoint to create an avatar. For instance, A2E has an endpoint to **“Create a Custom Avatar by a Video or Image”** which would return an avatar\_id we can use to generate videos. They claim half the cost of competitors and even allow starting for free with usage-based billing – which suits our budget (we could create a few avatars and only pay per video generated, staying well under $200). If we go with Wav2Lip locally, we’ll need to load the pre-trained model (there are PyTorch weights available) and use it in our backend pipeline to generate the video frames whenever the avatar speaks. This might require having a GPU accessible (for speed) and some extra coding, but is doable with code assistance. In summary, **to get the avatar’s visuals**, we will either (a) use the user’s image \+ an API for talking head video, or (b) use the user’s image \+ Wav2Lip model for lip-sync animation.

## 2\. Voice Cloning from the Sample Video

Next, we need the avatar to **speak in the user’s voice**. The short video will have the user’s real voice, which we can leverage to create a custom text-to-speech voice. This is the **voice cloning** step: given a few seconds or minutes of audio of Person X, produce a TTS system that can say arbitrary sentences in Person X’s voice.

**Feasible Voice Cloning Methods:** Impressively, recent AI models can clone a voice with very little data. For example, an open-source project by CorentinJ demonstrated cloning a voice from as little as a **5-second audio sample**[\[1\]](https://dev.to/anhducmata/ai-powered-conversational-avatar-system-tools-best-practices-oe0#:~:text=Voice%20Cloning%20Technologies%20%E2%80%93%20To,second%20audio%20sample%2C%20then) using a speaker-encoder and a synthesis network. This project (often referred to as “Real-Time Voice Cloning”) shows that even a few seconds can capture the basic timbre of a voice, though more audio (like a minute or two) improves quality. In our case, if the user’s video has them speaking for, say, 30 seconds or more, that should be plenty to get a decent clone.

We have two main routes for voice cloning:

* **Open-Source TTS Models:** We could use the aforementioned *Real-Time Voice Cloning* toolkit or other research models (like Meta’s *VITS* or Microsoft’s *YourTTS*) that support zero-shot or few-shot voice cloning. Many of these involve a pipeline: (1) encode the reference voice to a voiceprint vector, (2) use a TTS model (Tacotron or FastSpeech style) conditioned on that voiceprint to generate speech from text, (3) run a vocoder (like HiFi-GAN) to get the final audio. While this is possible to set up (there are pre-trained models available), doing it from scratch in 24h could be tricky. The quality can sometimes be hit-or-miss without fine-tuning. Still, it’s an option if we want to avoid external services entirely. The advantage is zero cost per use and full control.

* **Voice Cloning API Services:** To save time and maximize quality, we can use a service like **ElevenLabs** or **Resemble AI**, which specialize in ultra-realistic voice cloning. These services allow you to upload a few seconds or minutes of audio and will create a custom voice model in their system. Then you can call their API with text and get back speech audio that sounds like the person, with correct intonation and even emotional tone. For example, ElevenLabs’ API is known to produce very natural speech; they advertise cloning a voice in minutes and being able to speak in multiple languages with that voice[\[2\]](https://dev.to/anhducmata/ai-powered-conversational-avatar-system-tools-best-practices-oe0#:~:text=Voice%20Cloning%20Services%20%E2%80%93%20If,ElevenLabs%2C%20for). Since we have a budget for API usage and quality is important for a convincing demo, this is a great choice. We might use ElevenLabs: feed the user’s audio from the video to create a voice profile (ElevenLabs’ “VoiceLab” feature) – this might be done via their website or API. Once that’s set up, generating speech is as simple as calling the API with our text. Using a high-quality service addresses a potential pitfall of open-source clones: sometimes the cloned voice can sound robotic or fail on certain inflections. ElevenLabs and similar have largely solved that, delivering **very realistic speech from just a short sample**[\[2\]](https://dev.to/anhducmata/ai-powered-conversational-avatar-system-tools-best-practices-oe0#:~:text=Voice%20Cloning%20Services%20%E2%80%93%20If,ElevenLabs%2C%20for).

A2E’s platform actually integrates with ElevenLabs for voice cloning[\[3\]](https://a2e.ai/#:~:text=Voice%20Clone) – they mention that they “teamed up with ElevenLabs to offer powerful voice cloning” as part of their avatar toolkit. This means if we use A2E, we might be able to leverage that integration (possibly they handle sending the audio to ElevenLabs and we get a voice ID to use in their TTS). Alternatively, we can directly use the ElevenLabs API ourselves. There’s also the possibility of using other TTS like Google’s or Azure’s custom voice (Azure has a Custom Neural Voice that is excellent, but it requires an application and might not be accessible in a hackathon timeframe). Given familiarity and available credits, **ElevenLabs is a strong candidate** for the TTS. Resemble AI is another: they have a trial and can do voice cloning too, which is similar in pricing.

**Implementing Voice Clone:** The steps will be: extract the **audio track from the input video** (we can do this with FFMPEG or similar in code). Possibly do some preprocessing: ensure we have a clean segment of the user’s speech (remove background noise if needed). Then either call an API to create a voice clone or run an open-source model. For speed, let’s assume we use an API. With ElevenLabs, for example, we might manually (before the demo) create the voice and just use it in code. However, since the judges themselves might create their own clones live, we need a programmatic way. ElevenLabs doesn’t yet have a public API endpoint to *train* a new voice on the fly (their UI allows uploading samples). A2E **does** have an API endpoint *“Clone Voice from a Video”* which suggests you can POST a video file and they will internally create a voice (likely using ElevenLabs under the hood) and give you a voice ID. This is extremely convenient: the judge could upload their intro video, we call /api/v1/voiceclone on A2E, and get back a cloned voice ready to use for TTS. This approach keeps the flow automated and under our 24h implementation scope.

If for some reason that’s not viable, a backup is to use a slightly less realistic but easier method: use a generic TTS voice that is *similar* to the user’s (picking from a library of voices). This wouldn’t be a true clone, but if we’re desperate, at least the avatar can talk. However, since cloning tech is accessible and we want the *wow* factor of “it sounds like me\!”, we’ll focus on getting the actual clone voice working.

In summary, **we plan to clone the user’s voice by leveraging few-shot voice cloning technology** – either via a specialized API (like ElevenLabs) or an open library. This will give us a function synthesize(user\_text) \-\> audio that we can call whenever we need the avatar to speak. Early tests with a recorded sample will be needed to ensure the voice sounds right. (Note: We should also take care of *consent and security* – only clone the voice of the user who provided it, and handle the audio data responsibly. Voice cloning can be sensitive, so we’ll ensure this is done with user’s permission and data is not misused, which in our hack demo context should be fine.)

## 3\. Real-Time Speech Recognition and Input Handling

The user should be able to converse **naturally**, so we want to support voice input: the user can **speak a question or statement**, and the system will transcribe it to text for the AI to understand. We’ll also support text input (typing) as an alternative (some users might prefer typing or be in a noisy environment). The key component here is **Speech-to-Text (STT)** for converting spoken audio to text.

A robust choice for STT is **OpenAI’s Whisper**. Whisper is a state-of-the-art speech recognition model that is very accurate for English (and many languages) and can even handle accents and moderate background noise. We have two ways to use Whisper: via OpenAI’s hosted API or running it locally. The API (OpenAI Whisper API) would incur some cost per minute of audio, but it’s quite affordable and with our scale (short queries only) it should be well under budget. The latency is a few seconds for a query typically. Alternatively, we can run a smaller Whisper model locally in real-time. Whisper’s tiny or base model might run in real time on CPU, but for best accuracy the large model is better (which would need a GPU and is slower). Since the user will likely speak one sentence at a time, even the API’s few-second response is acceptable. Using the **OpenAI Whisper API** ensures we get high quality transcription easily.

There are also other STT options: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech, AssemblyAI, etc., all with similar or better accuracy and easy APIs. However, given we’re already using OpenAI for the LLM and possibly Whisper is included with our credits, it’s simplest to use that. The developer effort is just an HTTP call with the audio file/stream.

**Capturing the user’s voice:** On the front-end, we can use the Web Media APIs to record audio from the user’s microphone when they press a “Talk” button. This audio can be sent to the backend, either as a short WAV/MP3 after they finish speaking or even streamed chunk-by-chunk for realtime transcription (though streaming Whisper API isn’t straightforward, so likely we do the simpler approach: record, stop, send). Given a typical question might be 5-10 seconds of speech, the delay will be minimal. We should also include a normal text input box so the user can type and submit, in which case we skip STT and use the text directly.

**Output Display:** We will provide the response in voice/video form primarily, but we can also display the text of the avatar’s response as subtitles or in a chat bubble (this can be helpful for clarity, and also for accessibility if needed). Many avatar systems include captions (A2E’s video generation API has options for enabling subtitles in the video, as seen in their example payload). So we might even auto-generate captions with the avatar’s video. But at minimum, we can just show the response text in the UI as well.

To summarize, **Speech Recognition** will be handled by a reliable API like Whisper, triggered whenever the user speaks. This ensures our system can understand the user’s queries or responses in real time and pass them to the AI brain.

## 4\. The AI Brain: Conversational Intelligence with GPT-4/5

At the heart of the system is the AI model that will **generate responses** as the user’s clone. The plan is to use a powerful language model – presumably **OpenAI GPT-4** (the user mentioned “GPT-5” credits, which likely means access to the latest GPT model). This model will take in the transcribed user input (and the conversation context) and produce a helpful, relevant answer in natural language.

Key considerations for using GPT in this scenario:

* **Prompting and Persona:** We want the avatar to behave like the user’s “digital twin.” This means its manner of speaking, its knowledge and preferences, should over time resemble the user. We can achieve a baseline of this by careful prompt engineering. For example, we might construct a system prompt along the lines of: *“You are a digital clone of \[UserName\]. You speak in a similar style to them – for instance, \[some attributes: casual, uses slang, or formal, etc.\]. You know what they know (to the extent it’s been mentioned to you) and you have their preferences. Always respond as if you are \[UserName\] talking.”* If we have any information from the user’s initial video or setup (for example, we could ask the user to briefly describe themselves or the clone’s intended personality), we incorporate that. GPT-4 is quite adept at style adaptation if given a good description or a few examples. For instance, we could include a few **example exchanges** where the real user’s style is evident and tell the model to follow that style. This *few-shot prompting* approach can significantly guide the tone of the AI without any training.

If time allowed, an even more powerful approach is fine-tuning the model on the user’s own writing or transcripts. Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 on a person’s chat logs can teach it to mimic their tone remarkably well. However, fine-tuning is a longer process and wouldn’t be practical for each judge on the fly (and OpenAI’s fine-tune API might not support GPT-4 yet, only 3.5). So we’ll stick to prompt-based personalization. The prompt can be updated as we learn more about the user (see *Learning Preferences* below).

* **Maintaining Context (Memory):** We want multi-turn conversation where the avatar remembers what was said earlier. GPT-4 has a large context window (up to 8K or even 32K tokens if we have that edition), which is helpful. We will accumulate the dialogue history and include the relevant parts in each new query. A straightforward strategy is to keep the recent conversation in a list of messages (user says X, assistant says Y, etc.) and prepend that in the prompt for the next turn, within token limits. For a short demo conversation, this should be fine. If the conversation grew long, we might summarize or prune older turns to stay within context. Another advanced strategy is using a **vector database** to store embeddings of past dialogue and retrieve them as needed – this can help the AI recall older facts beyond the context window. Given our timeframe, we likely won’t need a full vector DB setup for a short-term interaction, but we can mention that for future persistence: e.g., store user facts so that even if the session is restarted, the clone can “remember” key info. In a polished product, we’d definitely want long-term memory (using something like Qdrant or Pinecone to do semantic search of past conversations), but for the hack demo, simple in-memory context is sufficient.

* **Handling Knowledge and Questions:** Since this avatar is supposed to be *the user*, it should ideally answer questions from the user’s perspective. If the user asks the clone something factual (like “What’s my favorite movie?”), presumably the user knows their own favorite movie and expects the clone to either know (if it learned it) or say it doesn’t know yet. We will have to feed the model any available personal info as context. Perhaps when setting up the clone, we can also have the user fill a short profile or the system can parse the user’s initial video for facts (if the user said “Hi, I’m Alice, I love hiking and I work as a designer,” we could transcribe that and give it to GPT as part of persona). This way, the clone could respond correctly about those facts. GPT-4 itself won’t know private details unless we explicitly supply them, so providing that context is key. We can also allow the clone to say “I don’t know that yet, can you tell me?” if asked something it wasn’t given – that way the user can *teach* the clone in conversation. This aligns with “updating its learning and memory to become more like you.” Over time, those user-provided answers can be added to the context or stored for future sessions.

* **Avoiding AI pitfalls:** We should give the model instructions to **stay in character** (only respond as the user’s persona, not mention it’s an AI, etc., unless we want it to). Also, possibly we should guard it from wandering into areas the user wouldn’t (e.g., if the user is not an expert in quantum physics, the clone shouldn’t suddenly act like one unless the user explicitly wants that). Essentially, the clone’s knowledge should mirror the user’s (with some flexibility since it’s backed by an all-knowing AI – but it could be weird if your clone starts spouting random knowledge you don’t have). A compromise is to let the clone use general knowledge to be helpful, but phrase it as “If I recall correctly…” or the like. For the demo, we can mostly let GPT-4 do its thing but guide it to focus on user’s interests.

**Implementation:** Using the OpenAI API (or Azure OpenAI if provided) is straightforward in code. We’ll use the chat completion API with a system message for persona, perhaps an assistant “memory” message with any known user profile, then the conversation messages. The model’s response text will be our avatar’s next line. Given GPT-4’s quality, we can rely on it to produce coherent, possibly even stylistically tuned responses. We will set the temperature low-ish (maybe 0.3) to maintain consistency and not have it go off-track, but not zero, so it’s not too stiff. Also, since we want real-time performance, note that GPT-4 can sometimes be a bit slower (\~1-2 seconds per 100 tokens). However, if the responses are short, it should return in a couple of seconds which is fine. If latency is an issue, one could use GPT-3.5 for faster replies at the cost of some sophistication – but for a wow demo, GPT-4 is preferable (especially if we have credits explicitly for it). Using streaming could also speed up perceived response; we could start generating the voice while the latter half of the text is still coming in. But implementing the stream might be too much detail for now – we can accept a 2-second thinking pause for each answer, which is not bad for a conversation with an AI.

In essence, **GPT will serve as the clone’s “brain”**, generating what the avatar says. We’ll give it initial knowledge of the user as much as possible, and use prompt techniques to keep it aligned with the user’s persona. This ensures the content of each response feels like something the user *might* say, which makes the illusion of the clone more convincing.

## 5\. Personalization and Learning the User’s Preferences

A key goal is that the avatar **learns from ongoing interactions** to become more like the user. This means two things: **remembering new information** the user shares, and **adapting to the user’s communication style/preferences**.

To remember information, as mentioned, we can continuously update the context or a stored profile with facts. For example, if in conversation the user says, “By the way, my favorite movie is *The Matrix*,” we should store that (in a simple dictionary or database) and next time if the AI is asked or speaking, it should recall that fact. In a multi-turn chat, GPT-4 will recall if it was in the recent context. But if a new session starts, we’d want to retrieve those saved facts and include them in the prompt (e.g., “The user’s favorite movie is The Matrix,” possibly as part of the system prompt or persona). Since during the hack each judge might only do a short interaction, we might not implement persistent storage, but we **will let the clone dynamically incorporate any facts given in the conversation**. GPT-4 is quite good at picking up on those cues.

Adapting to style is interesting: Initially, we set a style based on whatever data we have (maybe the user’s initial video transcript or their writing sample if any). As the conversation proceeds, we can observe how the user talks to the avatar. If the user tends to use very informal language, we might adjust the clone’s responses to be even more informal. If the user explicitly says “Can you be more funny?” or “Speak more like I do with short texts,” we can adjust the system instruction on the fly. Essentially, the system could perform a rudimentary **sentiment or style analysis** on the user’s messages to tweak the clone’s tone. For example, if user’s sentences are short and full of internet slang, but the clone was initially too verbose, we can instruct GPT mid-session to shorten responses and use similar slang. We could detect this manually or even prompt GPT to analyze the user’s style (“From the above messages, determine if the user prefers casual tone.” etc.). This might be overkill in 24h, but it’s an idea for fine-tuning the experience.

Because GPT-4 is so flexible, often just *telling it* to mirror the user’s last message style is effective. We could do something like: include the user’s last message as an example and say “Answer with a similar tone/length.” There’s even research showing GPT can do style transfer well with few-shot examples. Given time constraints, the simplest path is: **start with a reasonable persona prompt and let the user correct the avatar via conversation**. If the user says “No, don’t call me Sir, just be casual,” the avatar’s next response can acknowledge and switch tone. We can manually incorporate those instructions by appending to the system prompt (or as high-priority user instructions).

One more aspect is **emotional adaptation** – e.g., if the user is upset, the clone might respond in a calming way, etc. This was mentioned in some best-practice guides. Implementing emotion detection (perhaps via a simple sentiment analysis on user input) could allow us to modify the clone’s responses to be more empathetic when needed. This is a nice touch, but not essential for the initial demo unless we have extra time.

In summary, our clone will become more personalized by **accumulating knowledge** (from user input) and **modulating style** based on user feedback and conversation. We will maintain an internal **profile** (some key-value pairs like name, age, favorites, etc., plus notes on tone preferences) and ensure the GPT prompt is updated to reflect that profile. Over multiple interactions, this should converge toward a fairly personalized behavior. It won’t truly *learn* like retraining the model in 24h, but GPT-4 with iterative prompt updates should simulate learning well enough.

## 6\. System Architecture and Integration Plan

Now, let’s outline how all these components tie together in a working system, and what tools we’ll use for each part. The architecture can be viewed as a pipeline that triggers for each user query. We can break it into two phases: **initial clone setup** (processing the user’s video to set up the avatar) and **interactive loop** (handling the back-and-forth conversation).

**Initial Setup (One-Time per User Clone):**  
1\. **User Video Upload/Recording:** The user provides a short video of themselves speaking. This could be done via an upload form or by recording directly in the browser (using getUserMedia to record \~30 seconds of video). For a smoother demo, we might allow the judge to record within our app and then hit “Create My Clone.”  
2\. **Extract Photo for Avatar:** On the server, receive the video file. Use a library (FFmpeg) to grab a good frame (or a few). Possibly use face detection to pick a frame where the user’s face is clearly visible and centered. Save this frame as the avatar image.  
3\. **Extract Audio for Voice:** Also use FFmpeg or similar to get the audio track (WAV/MP3). If the video is longer than needed, we might trim to the most clear portion or just use it whole.  
4\. **Voice Clone Creation:** Invoke the voice cloning process with the extracted audio. If using A2E API, call the *Clone Voice from Video* endpoint, which returns a voice ID or a model we can use. If using ElevenLabs directly, we might have a pre-defined slot (since the judges might create multiple clones, in a multi-user scenario we’d create multiple voices – perhaps using their API if possible). Alternatively, we can run an open-source voice encoder to get a voice embedding for later use (if we had an open TTS model). But likely, using ElevenLabs: we might script something like using their Python SDK to create a voice (requires an API key and sending the audio file). This step might take some seconds. 5\. **Avatar Model/Setup:** If using an API for avatar video, we need to create the avatar entity. For D-ID, this might mean nothing special (we can directly send image+audio for each request). For A2E, we might call *Create A Custom Avatar* with the image (and possibly the video for better lip model) which returns an avatar\_id. This could take a minute if it trains a lip-sync model; but we might skip training and just use the image with their default model. Anyway, we store whatever ID or info is needed to generate videos of that avatar. If using Wav2Lip, we’ll load the Wav2Lip model into memory now and just keep the avatar image ready; no further setup needed.  
6\. **Test/Prefetch (optional):** It might be wise to do a quick test generation (like make the avatar say a hello message) to ensure all parts are working. This could also warm up any model. If using a streaming avatar service, at this point we’d set up the streaming session (e.g., get an Agora token from A2E and be ready to join the channel on the front-end).

After this setup, the user is presented with the interactive chat interface where they can converse with their now-initialized clone.

**Interactive Loop (Each Query/Response Cycle):**  
When the user says something (or types something), the following happens:

1. **Capture User Input:** If voice, the browser records audio until the user stops speaking (or we implement push-to-talk). Then it sends the audio clip to the backend (via a WebSocket or an HTTP POST). If text, we send the text directly via an API call (or WebSocket message).

2. **Speech-to-Text (if needed):** The backend receives audio, and uses the STT engine to transcribe it to text (e.g., call OpenAI Whisper API with the audio file). The result is the user’s query in text form.

3. **Query Processing / AI Response:** The backend then constructs the prompt for GPT. This includes the conversation history and persona as discussed. For example, we might have a global system prompt like: *“You are the digital clone of \[Name\]. \[Some style instructions\]. You will respond to the user maintaining their persona.”* Then we include a few recent turns: User: “(last question)”, AI: “(last answer)”, etc., and now User: “(current question)”. We send this to the OpenAI API (with the appropriate model, e.g. gpt-4). The API returns the assistant’s answer text.

4. **Text-to-Speech:** We take the assistant’s answer text and feed it to the TTS system to generate the audio in the cloned voice. If using ElevenLabs via API, we provide the text and the voice ID we created earlier, and get back an audio file (usually a URL to download or the binary data). If using an open TTS, we run the synthesis function with the stored voice embedding. The output is an audio waveform (e.g. an MP3 or WAV data).

5. **Avatar Video Generation:** Now we have the audio of the response. To present the talking avatar, we either generate a video or use a streaming mechanism:

6. *If using a video generation API:* e.g., with A2E, call the **Generate AI Avatar Video** endpoint, providing the avatar\_id (the user’s face) and the audio URL or audio data. The API will process and produce a video file (like an MP4) where the avatar speaks that audio with lip-sync. We then have to retrieve that video (the API might give a URL or we poll until ready). The generation might take a couple of seconds (they mention possibly slower if high-res or if “Smart Motion” is on, but hopefully for a short sentence it’s quick). Once ready, we can send that video to the frontend or host it for streaming.

7. *If using a streaming avatar service:* e.g., with A2E’s Streaming Avatar (using Agora), we would instead send the text or audio to the avatar’s “room” via an endpoint like *Ask a Question to the Avatar* or *Let the Avatar Speak Directly*. Their system would then immediately play that on the avatar and stream the video live to the front-end (which is subscribed to the Agora video channel). In this case, the synchronization and rendering are handled by their backend, and we just feed it the content. This gives the lowest latency response (since frames start coming in as the avatar speaks). However, integrating Agora (which involves using their JavaScript SDK on the client to receive the live video stream) is a bit complex if we haven’t before. It’s doable within 24h with their documentation, but as a backup, generating a video file for each response might be simpler to implement.

8. *If using Wav2Lip locally:* we feed the avatar image and the generated audio into the Wav2Lip model (which will output a series of video frames or a completed video file). We then produce a video (or possibly a GIF/WebM) and send it to the client. This will require that our backend server has enough CPU/GPU to do this quickly. Wav2Lip can often run faster than real time on a GPU (e.g., a 5-second audio might take a couple seconds to synthesize video). If on CPU, it might be slower (\~10-15 seconds for 5 seconds audio on a single core), which might be too laggy. We will likely run this on a machine with a GPU if possible (maybe our local dev machine or a cloud VM for the demo). We’d have to send the video data to the browser – perhaps as a WebM base64 string or as a static file URL that the browser can fetch.

9. *Alternative approach:* If everything fails, as an extremely simple approach, we could show a static image of the user and just play the audio (like a voice assistant with a photo). But the requirement is clearly to have the mouth move, so we want to avoid falling back to that. However, it’s good to note as a contingency.

10. **Playing the Avatar’s Response:** On the front-end, we now need to present the avatar’s answer to the user. If we got a video file (MP4/WebM), we can simply display a video element. We might choose to autoplay it and then remove it when done, or for a continuous feel, perhaps update the source of a single video element each time (though that can cause flicker between videos; maybe better to use one \<video\> and replace content). If using streaming (Agora), the video element is continuously playing the stream, so the avatar appears persistent and just speaks whenever a new answer comes. We will ensure the transition between answers is smooth. We’ll also output the response text somewhere (subtitle or chat bubble) in case the audio wasn’t clear or just for user reference.

11. **Looping**: Now we go back to waiting for the user’s next input. The context is updated with this latest exchange (so the model remembers what it just said and what was asked). This loop continues until the conversation is ended.

Throughout this loop, we must keep latency as low as possible for a real-time feel. The slowest parts are likely: GPT-4 response (maybe 1-3 seconds), and video generation (depending on method, could be 2-4 seconds). So the user might experience perhaps \~5 seconds from speaking to seeing the avatar reply, which is actually not bad (feels like a short pause). If we can optimize with streaming GPT or streaming video, we could cut that down, but even as is, it should be acceptable in a demo. The judges will likely be understanding that some processing is happening. We can also add a small **“avatar is thinking...” animation or audio cue** in the UI while they wait.

**Tech Stack Considerations:** We have flexibility, but here’s a likely setup: \- *Backend:* Could be **Node.js/Express** or **Python/FastAPI** or even a combination. Python has the advantage of readily available libraries for things like Wav2Lip, audio processing, etc. Also controlling multimedia (FFmpeg, etc.) might be easier via Python. The dev.to guide recommended FastAPI for async performance, which is a good choice if we expect concurrent users, but for a hack demo (one user at a time), even a simple Flask synchronous app might suffice. Node could be used especially if we lean on external APIs (since Node can call those just as well and stream data). Since the user mentioned GPT-Codex and possibly coding in Python, we might lean towards a Python backend. We’ll ensure to use asynchronous calls where possible (e.g., use aiohttp or FastAPI’s async features) so that we don’t block on external API calls too much. \- *Front-End:* Likely a simple **web app (HTML/JS)**. We can use React or just vanilla JS depending on comfort. Given time, a minimal React app on Next.js (since Vercel was mentioned) could be done. Next.js could serve the pages and also have API routes for the backend, but heavy audio/video processing might not fit in a serverless function. Possibly we separate: run a Python server for the heavy lifting and have the front-end talk to it via REST/WebSocket. For the hack, running everything locally might actually be easiest (the judges could interact on the developer’s laptop). If we try to host on Vercel, we’d likely use client-side to call OpenAI and other APIs directly – but that’s problematic due to API keys exposure. So more likely we keep a controlled backend.

* *Communication:* We can use **WebSockets** for a smoother full-duplex communication (especially if we want to later add streaming or to send incremental updates). But implementing WebSocket in both front and back adds complexity. A simpler route: front-end makes a fetch request for each user query and waits for response (the response can include the video or audio data or a URL to it). This is fine for turn-by-turn interaction. If we go with streaming avatar via Agora, then we will definitely incorporate their real-time channel: the front-end will handle video streaming and we’ll still need a way to notify the backend when user speaks and vice versa. That’s a bit more engineering, so unless we are comfortable with Agora quickly, the sequential fetch approach is okay.

* *File Handling:* We should be careful with handling the video/audio files. We may need to store the user’s video temporarily, store the avatar image, etc. For speed, we might keep things in memory or a temp directory. If using external APIs that require a URL (like D-ID or A2E often take URLs to media), we might need to upload the file to a cloud storage or use a presigned upload. A2E fortunately provides an endpoint to upload media to their storage if needed. Alternatively, we can encode audio as base64 and send in JSON if allowed. We will find the easiest way to send data to these APIs. If running local Wav2Lip, no such issue – we just handle it internally.

* *Error Handling:* Considering the time, we should add some basic error cases: e.g., if speech recognition fails (the user’s speech not clear), maybe ask them to repeat. If GPT returns something inappropriate or too long, we might truncate. If the voice or video generation fails, perhaps fall back to text response to not stall the demo. Having some safeguards will make the demo robust.

Overall, here’s a quick step-by-step of the **planned integration flow** (tying it all together):

1. **User provides video** – processed into avatar image and audio.

2. **Clone voice** via ElevenLabs/A2E – obtain voice\_id.

3. **Create avatar model** via A2E or prepare Wav2Lip with the image.

4. **Start chat UI** – show avatar image on screen, maybe a greeting.

5. **User speaks or types a question** (e.g., “What’s your name?” to test).

6. **STT** converts speech to text (“What’s your name?”).

7. **GPT** gets prompt \[persona: I am Alice’s clone... \+ conversation\] and question, outputs answer text (e.g., “My name is Alice, I’m your AI clone\!”).

8. **TTS** synthesizes that text in Alice’s voice to audio.

9. **Lip-sync video** is generated with Alice’s face and the audio.

10. **Client plays video** of avatar speaking the answer.

11. Loop back to user for next question… e.g., user: “What do you like?”, and so on.

12. Throughout, the conversation context builds, and we inject any new facts into GPT’s prompt. If the user says “I actually prefer coffee to tea,” we remember that and next time maybe the clone will not forget it.

This pipeline is very much in line with what some existing demos have done. In fact, there’s an open-source project that did something similar: it combined GPT-3, Whisper, ElevenLabs, and a lip-sync tool (Rhubarb) to create a digital human. Their workflow for text and audio input is essentially what we described, just using a different lip-sync mechanism (they used a 3D avatar and Rhubarb for viseme generation). Knowing that such a pipeline has been successfully implemented gives confidence in our approach. We just have to implement each step cleanly and ensure the components connect.

Given we only have 24 hours, a realistic approach is to **use as many pre-built services as possible for heavy tasks (voice and video)**, and glue them together with some straightforward code. We will spend time on the tricky parts like asynchronous handling of responses, ensuring the UI updates correctly, and testing with one example user (likely ourselves) before letting judges try.

## 7\. Feasibility, Testing, and Budget Considerations

**Time Feasibility:** With GPT-codex assisting, we can rapidly write the integration code for API calls (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.) and possibly some simple UI. The major unknown is debugging any issues in connecting the video/avatar API. Therefore, a priority is to test the critical path early: for instance, try generating a small talking video via the chosen method to gauge speed and quality. If the API route for video proves too slow or problematic, we may switch to local Wav2Lip (for which we should have the model ready to go as a fallback).

Because each piece individually is well-documented (OpenAI API, TTS API, etc.), the implementation is mostly about managing data flow and timing. We should modularize tasks so that we can replace components if needed (e.g., have an interface for “generate\_avatar\_video” that we can point to either A2E or local Wav2Lip without changing the rest of the code).

**Testing Plan:** We will test each component in isolation first: \- Run a short voice clip through the STT to confirm transcription. \- Send a dummy prompt to GPT to ensure we get a response. \- Synthesize a known text with the cloned voice (maybe after creating the voice, have it say “Hello, I am \[Name\]” to verify it sounds right). \- Feed that audio and the image into the lip-sync method and see if the output video looks okay (maybe using a known phrase to visually inspect lip correctness). \- Also test the full loop with a simple conversation script to catch any obvious mismatches (e.g., ensure that the voice audio length matches video length, etc. – usually they should, but if using certain codecs might need to align).

We should also consider the **length of responses** – if GPT gives a very long answer, the video generation might take longer or the user might lose patience. Possibly we should instruct GPT to keep answers concise unless asked to elaborate. We can set a max tokens limit.

**Budget and API Usage:** Let’s estimate costs to ensure we stay \<$200: \- OpenAI GPT-4: Suppose each query+response is \~500 tokens (including context). GPT-4 is about $0.03/1K tokens for prompt \+ $0.06/1K for output (depending on exact pricing). So 500 tokens \~ $0.045. If each judge has, say, a 5-turn conversation, that’s \~$0.225 per user. For a handful of judges, trivial cost. Even with overhead, likely \<$5 total. \- Whisper STT: \~$0.006 per 10 seconds of audio (OpenAI’s price). Each user query \~5 seconds, many queries, still likely \<$1 in total. \- ElevenLabs: They have a free tier (like 10,000 characters which might cover a demo). If not, their paid is not expensive: e.g., $5 can get a decent number of generated minutes. We might generate maybe a few minutes of speech overall, which should be fine. Voice cloning might require a subscription (I recall custom voices might need at least a basic plan $5 or $22 depending on usage). Let’s assume under $20 for safety. \- Video avatar (D-ID or A2E): This could be the larger cost. D-ID’s API, for instance, might charge a certain amount per minute of video generated. If each response is \~5 seconds and each judge does a few, maybe we generate on the order of 30-60 seconds of video per user. If the rate was (for example) $0.01 per second, that would be $0.50 per user, which is fine. A2E’s pricing claims to be cheap; they even allow some free minutes. They mention starting at $0.64/min for instant clone videos, which is \~$0.011 per second. So 1 minute of output is $0.64. Our demo might produce a couple of minutes at most, so maybe $1-2 per user. With a few users, well under $200. If there’s a monthly $9.90 subscription needed, we can include that. Still fine. \- If we run Wav2Lip locally, that’s free aside from computing resources (we might use our own machine or a free GPU from Colab if needed). So that could save cost if needed, but given our budget it’s not an issue to use the API for convenience.

Everything appears to fit in the budget with a comfortable margin. We will keep an eye on any hidden costs (like if we accidentally use a lot of GPT tokens by including too much history).

**Deployment:** Ideally, we’d host this so judges can use it on their devices. Vercel could host the front-end easily, but the back-end might need to be somewhere because of the heavy processing. One approach: Host the back-end on a cloud VM or Heroku-like service with a GPU (for Wav2Lip) or at least a strong CPU. If using external APIs for video, a normal server is fine. Vercel’s serverless functions have a timeout (usually 10s) which might be tight if we do video gen in-line. We might circumvent that by having the front-end poll for video status if it takes longer. Or we use a separate service (like an A2E streaming which runs independently). Given hack constraints, it might be acceptable to run it locally and just let judges come to the laptop to try. But if needed, maybe we can quickly deploy the core to an AWS EC2 instance.

**UX Considerations:** We’ll aim for a simple UI: a video box (showing the avatar’s face), a text box and send button, and a microphone button to talk. We should indicate when the system is processing (a spinner or “Listening...” / “Thinking...” message). When the avatar speaks, ensure the user hears it (we’ll have an audio element possibly connected to the video or separate). We might also allow the user to mute if they just want to read text. These are small touches we can add if time permits.

Finally, we will **iterate quickly** with our own clone as a test. It’s important to experience it and adjust the prompt or timing to make the conversation flow naturally. For example, if we find GPT’s answers are too formal, we’ll tweak the persona prompt. If the voice sometimes says something differently (e.g., the TTS might mispronounce a name), we might have to handle that (like using phonetic spelling or an SSML tag if supported). We should also verify lip-sync alignment – e.g., if using an API that returns video, they ensure sync. If using Wav2Lip, we trust it, but we’ll verify a couple sentences.

By covering these bases, we should be in a good position to have a **working demo**: the judge will upload a short video of themselves, then within a minute they’ll be greeted by an avatar that looks and sounds like them, and they can ask it questions. The novelty of seeing “themselves” talk back with knowledge of what they told it will hopefully be impressive\!

## 8\. References and Inspiration

Our approach is informed by existing research and tools in AI avatars. For instance, the open-source project *“Talking Avatar with AI”* showed the viability of chaining GPT, Whisper, ElevenLabs, and a lip-sync solution to achieve a talking digital human. Services like D-ID and A2E have emerged to make real-time conversational avatars possible via API, and their documentation provided insight into how to integrate streaming video and audio. The choice of Wav2Lip as a baseline is supported by its strong performance among lip-sync models. For voice, the success of few-shot cloning is well documented – e.g., the Real-Time Voice Cloning toolkit cloning voices from 5 seconds of audio[\[1\]](https://dev.to/anhducmata/ai-powered-conversational-avatar-system-tools-best-practices-oe0#:~:text=Voice%20Cloning%20Technologies%20%E2%80%93%20To,second%20audio%20sample%2C%20then) – and the high quality of ElevenLabs is noted in enabling realistic intonation from short samples[\[2\]](https://dev.to/anhducmata/ai-powered-conversational-avatar-system-tools-best-practices-oe0#:~:text=Voice%20Cloning%20Services%20%E2%80%93%20If,ElevenLabs%2C%20for). On personalization, recent experiments show fine-tuning and prompting can imbue an AI with a user’s speaking style (learning tone faster than exact facts), and simple persona prompts or examples are powerful for style transfer. We will leverage these insights to ensure our clone isn’t just visually and vocally similar, but also **behaves** like the user as much as possible in the short development time.

By combining these state-of-the-art tools and techniques, we are essentially orchestrating a mini-“production” pipeline: the user’s speech is the input to a conversation engine (GPT) and the output is rendered through voice and animation to produce a life-like conversational agent. With careful engineering and testing, this is absolutely achievable within a 24-hour hackathon period, as long as we lean on existing APIs for the heavy lifting and focus our coding on integration. The end result will be a compelling demonstration of an **interactive AI clone** that operates in real-time – a showcase of how far AI generative tech has come in enabling personalized digital avatars.
